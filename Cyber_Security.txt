Title: Design and Implementation of a Secure Enterprise Network Using pfSense Firewall, IDS/IPS, and Access Control

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a secure enterprise network architecture using a pfSense firewall, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), and strict access control mechanisms. The network infrastructure is logically segmented into three security zones—WAN, DMZ, and LAN—in accordance with industry best practices for enterprise network security.


1. pfSense Firewall Installation and Network Segmentation

- Install and configure the pfSense firewall.

- Create and configure three network interfaces:

	- WAN (External Network)

	- DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

	- LAN (Internal Secure Network)

- Firewall Rule Configuration

	- Allow traffic from WAN to DMZ for HTTP and HTTPS services only.

	- Block all traffic from WAN to LAN.

	- Block all traffic from DMZ to LAN, except database service access from the web server.


2. Web Server Deployment in the DMZ

- Deploy and configure a web server within the DMZ network.

- Access the web application using the URL:	
	http://todo.sunbeam.local

- Configure internal DNS resolution for todo.sunbeam.local using pfSense.

- Generate and configure an SSL/TLS certificate to enable secure access over HTTPS:
	https://todo.sunbeam.local


3. Database Server Deployment in the LAN

- Deploy the database server within the LAN network.

- Configure firewall rules to allow database connections only from the DMZ-based web server.

- Block all other internal and external access to the database server to ensure data security.


4. Network Monitoring Using Nagios

- Install and configure Nagios for infrastructure monitoring.

	- Add the web server and database server as monitored hosts.

	- Configure service checks to monitor:

		- Server availability

		- Resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)

		- Service health

		- HTTP and HTTPS services


5. Intrusion Detection and Prevention

- Install and configure Snort as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) on the database server.

- Enable and tune relevant rule sets to detect and prevent malicious activities targeting database services.

- Examples of detected attacks include:

	- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

	- Ping of Death attacks


6. Attack Simulation and Log Analysis

- Launch simulated attacks from a Kali Linux machine targeting the web server and database server.

- Observe, analyze, and verify the generated alerts and logs on the Snort-enabled database server.

- Validate the effectiveness of IDS rules by correlating attack attempts with detected events in Snort logs.
